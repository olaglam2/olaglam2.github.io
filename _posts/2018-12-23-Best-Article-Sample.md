“Run Forrest, Run!” Probably one of the most famous phrases in movie history, but how did Forrest run across the whole country without suffering a knee injury? Patellofemoral pain syndrome is referred to as ‘runner’s knee’, but it can affect anybody. The condition is more common in athletes, but also affects office employees and anyone who sits for prolonged periods.

Here’s the good news!

A generic term for pain at the front of the knee, in most cases of patellofemoral pain syndrome there’s no actual damage to the knee joint. Surgery is rarely needed, with common treatments involving physiotherapy or the use of a knee brace.

When combined with other knee rehabilitation treatments, a knee support brace will play a key part in relieving patellofemoral pain. If you suffer from a nagging pain at the front of the knee, don’t worry we’ve got you covered as we look at options for the best brace for patellofemoral pain syndrome.

##  What Is Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome?
Here is our review of the five top throwing knives we’ve found.

What Is Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome?

Patellofemoral syndrome is the condition that describes pain in the front of your knee and around the kneecap, known as the patella. When the patella has improper tracking in the femoral groove, it’ll cause a sharp pain or a dull ache around or underneath the kneecap. This often gets worse with movement around the knee area when going about daily activities or bending the knee while weight bearing.

Although it affects millions of us, patellofemoral pain syndrome is more frequent in athletic individuals like runners, hikers or cyclists. A survey found that 25 percent of all knee injuries seen in a sports medicine clinic were related to patellofemoral pain. Overuse of the knee joint and trauma like falling on your kneecaps are common causes.

Poor tracking of your patella in the groove at the end of your femur has been linked with patellofemoral pain syndrome too. When you bend your knee, sometimes the kneecap will be pushed out to one side caused by muscular imbalances or weaknesses. While symptoms of patellofemoral syndrome can be extremely painful, the condition can usually be treated in your own home.

## Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Treatment
Once diagnosed, a doctor will recommend the best course of action for treating your patellofemoral pain. This can include orthotics which take the stress off your lower leg by stabilizing your foot and ankle.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which reduce the swelling and relieve the pain are another option. Over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen and acetaminophen will help with healing too. Always consult your doctor before taking any new medications.

#### Exercise to Treat and Prevent Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome

Gentle exercise and stretches will improve your strength and mobility without risking further damage to the knee. By strengthening the muscles attached to your knee, you’ll reduce the patellofemoral pain. In the following YouTube video, a physiotherapist details some exercises and stretches that’ll get your patella back on track.




#### Rest and Compression

As patellofemoral pain syndrome is often caused by overuse or overactivity, resting the affected area can help treat the condition. The RICE method (rest, ice, compression and elevation) will relieve the pain and help reduce any swelling. Taping or a bandage may be used for compression but the effects will decrease over time.

#### Patellar Braces

The best brace for patellofemoral pain will apply an external force that counteracts improper patella tracking. Studies have shown that patellar braces significantly alter the patellar tracking. One study found using a knee brace alters the position of the patella in the femoral groove of patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Basically it puts your knee back in the groove.

A knee support brace will stop the patella from deviating too far laterally, but the patella can move in other planes too. Using a knee brace with therapeutic exercises will help ease that pain more effectively.

## The Best Brace for Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome

With so many types of knee supports available, it can be difficult to know which is the best brace for patellofemoral pain syndrome. It’s important to choose the correct brace to address your type of knee pain.

Patellar tendinitis is a similar condition but presents itself on the front of your shin bone and treatment normally requires a patella strap. This creates a false insertion point on your tendons which takes pressure from the sore and inflamed area of pain.

Knee braces for patellofemoral pain are usually a sleeve-style of brace that’ll control or restrict the movement of your knee cap. An open patella-design will reduce the stress caused by movement on the kneecap, with many braces featuring a reinforced patella opening. This can take the form of a gel pad or buttress which assists with the medial tracking of the patella and relieve the pressure or stress on your kneecap.

We’ve looked at many of the top-selling braces to bring you, in our opinion, the best five options for the best brace for patellofemoral pain syndrome.

 ### Bauerfeind GenuTrain P3 Knee Support 
 ![My helpful screenshot](images/posts/16.jpg)

 The GenuTrain P3 knee brace has been designed to relieve pain from the misalignment of the knee cap with P3 standing for permanent patella protection. Using a corrective strap, an integrated ring-shaped pad holds the kneecap securely and prevents drifting. This knitted brace/sleeve can be used to treat and prevent patellofemoral pain syndrome, chondromalacia, dislocation of the knee or other patella-related problems.

What we particularly like about this knee brace is the knitted cotton fabric is both breathable and moisture wicking yet offers a medical-grade compression. Along with a wide range of sizing options that go beyond small, medium or large, this sleeve offers an all-day comfortable fit that won’t slip or bunch up. An incorporated viscoelastic Omega pad surrounds your kneecap to relieve pain and provide a massaging pressure.

###  Neo-G Hinged Open-Patella Knee Brace 
 ![My helpful screenshot](images/posts/16.jpg)
 If you’re looking for some high-grade support and stabilization, this brace has you covered. Registered internationally as a class 1 medical device with regulatory bodies including the FDA, this brace is manufactured to the highest quality and compliant standards. A side-hinge system and premium-grade neoprene use a non-slip design for the ultimate comfort and support, suitable for everyday activities and sports.

A reinforced patellar gap aids with patellar tracking while a two-point geared hinge system helps control flexion and extension movements of connected muscles. A variable compression system (VCS) uses three straps to ensure blood flow safety while providing maximum joint protection and stability. One size fits all, is suitable for use by both men and women and is comfortable to wear with the heat therapeutic neoprene fabric.

### Vive Knee Brace 
 ![My helpful screenshot](images/posts/16.jpg)

This budget-priced all-purpose knee brace from Vive can help with knee stability and support, preventing or treating the symptoms of patellofemoral pain syndrome. A reinforced open-patella design supports your kneecap and reduces the pressure and stress created by movement. Proper alignment of the ACL and MCL helps to relieve strains, sprains and improves patellar tracking while allowing for a full range of motion.

Secured with three strong hook-and-loop straps, the knee brace fits most knees up to 17.5 inches in circumference. You can also tighten or loosen the straps to achieve the optimal level of compression and support needed for pain relief. A durable Neoprene fabric is used which is naturally moisture wicking and breathable to keep you cool and dry.

## Our Choice
When choosing a brace to relieve the pain at the front of your knee, it’s most important to choose one which fits securely and offers constant support to the patella. The wide range of six different sizes which go above and beyond the normal universal sizing of similar knee braces, in our opinion, makes the Bauerfeind GenuTrain P3 knee support the best brace for patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Although the price may be higher than many other braces, you’re getting a great-quality knee support that’s been specifically designed for your condition. A soft cotton knitted fabric provides breathable compression and gives anatomic support wherever actually needed with an integrated gel-ring pad to hold the kneecap securely in place. Using this knee support brace will soon get you pounding those tracks again, just with less pain next time.










## 4. Audio Interface
Like a mixing console in a major pro studio, the audio interface is the heart of any project studio, so it's important to make the right choice. I'll explain which interface I bought and why, describe its features and how I feel about my decision.
{% include image.html
            img="images/posts/16.jpg"
            title="title for image"
            caption="caption for image" %}

## 5. Digital Audio Workstation & Control Surfaces
Another important choice in setting up a project studio is the choice of Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). There is little to differentiate between DAWs in terms of quality these days, but there are significant differences in interface design, workflow and cost. Platform too (PC vs. Mac) will rule some options out as there are some PC-only and Mac-only options out there.  


## 6. Studio Monitors & Headphones
Studio monitors and headphones are another critical choice. These determine what you hear and will massively impact the success of your mixes - both in terms of overall balance and how well they translate to other listening devices and environments. I'll explain what monitors I bought and how I chose them. 


#### 7. Cabling
Not the most glamorous subject, but important none-the-less. I'll go through my cabling choices.


### 8. Future Upgrades
I'll finish off the series with some thoughts on areas where I could improve the studio in future. I have no idea whether I will ever have the budget to implement any of these, but it's a pleasant way to pass some time!
