###### _1. Garden Studio_

I'll kick the series off by explaining what motivated me to build a garden studio, what I use it for and how this affected design decisions. I'll cover how I chose a supplier and provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the build from laying the concrete base to the finished building. This may end up being split into two posts if it gets too long: planning/choosing a supplier; build walkthrough.

## 2. Studio Signal Flow

An explanation of the audio signal flow from voice/instrument to speakers/headphones. This is a generic flow that could be applied to any studio, but I will describe it in terms of my own set up.

## 3. Microphones

I'll cover all the different microphones I own, why I chose them and what I use them for. I'll also identify where there are gaps in my collection and how I might fill them in the future.

## 4. Audio Interface

Like a mixing console in a major pro studio, the audio interface is the heart of any project studio, so it's important to make the right choice. I'll explain which interface I bought and why, describe its features and how I feel about my decision.

## 5. Digital Audio Workstation & Control Surfaces

Another important choice in setting up a project studio is the choice of Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). There is little to differentiate between DAWs in terms of quality these days, but there are significant differences in interface design, workflow and cost. Platform too (PC vs. Mac) will rule some options out as there are some PC-only and Mac-only options out there.

## 6. Studio Monitors & Headphones

Studio monitors and headphones are another critical choice. These determine what you hear and will massively impact the success of your mixes - both in terms of overall balance and how well they translate to other listening devices and environments. I'll explain what monitors I bought and how I chose them.

## 7. Cabling

Not the most glamorous subject, but important none-the-less. I'll go through my cabling choices.

### 8. Future Upgrades

I'll finish off the series with some thoughts on areas where I could improve the studio in future. I have no idea whether I will ever have the budget to implement any of these, but it's a pleasant way to pass some time!
