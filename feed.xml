        <title>My new Post frame that i want to confirm with</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h6 id=&quot;1-garden-studio&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Garden Studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll kick the series off by explaining what motivated me to build a garden studio, what I use it for and how this affected design decisions. I’ll cover how I chose a supplier and provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the build from laying the concrete base to the finished building. This may end up being split into two posts if it gets too long: planning/choosing a supplier; build walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2--flow&quot;&gt;2 . &lt;a href=&quot;https://forestry.io/docs/editing&quot;&gt;Flow&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An explanation of the audio signal flow from voice/instrument to speakers/headphones. This is a generic flow that could be applied to any studio, but I will describe it in terms of my own set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-microphones&quot;&gt;3. Microphones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll cover all the different microphones I own, why I chose them and what I use them for. I’ll also identify where there are gaps in my collection and how I might fill them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-audio-interface&quot;&gt;4. Audio Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a mixing console in a major pro studio, the audio interface is the heart of any project studio, so it’s important to make the right choice. I’ll explain which interface I bought and why, describe its features and how I feel about my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-digital-audio-workstation--control-surfaces&quot;&gt;5. Digital Audio Workstation &amp;amp; Control Surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important choice in setting up a project studio is the choice of Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). There is little to differentiate between DAWs in terms of quality these days, but there are significant differences in interface design, workflow and cost. Platform too (PC vs. Mac) will rule some options out as there are some PC-only and Mac-only options out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-studio-monitors--headphones&quot;&gt;6. Studio Monitors &amp;amp; Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studio monitors and headphones are another critical choice. These determine what you hear and will massively impact the success of your mixes - both in terms of overall balance and how well they translate to other listening devices and environments. I’ll explain what monitors I bought and how I chose them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-cabling&quot;&gt;7. Cabling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the most glamorous subject, but important none-the-less. I’ll go through my cabling choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-future-upgrades&quot;&gt;8. Future Upgrades&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll finish off the series with some thoughts on areas where I could improve the studio in future. I have no idea whether I will ever have the budget to implement any of these, but it’s a pleasant way to pass some time!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ck 285 Bantam BLW Mossy Oak Pink Camo Pocket Knife</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-pink&quot;&gt;WHY PINK?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So glad you asked!  I’ve asked myself that question a number of times as I noticed more and more excellent PINK knives from America’s top companies like Spyderco, Ontario Knife Co., Buck, Kershaw, etc.  What’s the deal?  I asked that question to Ontario Knife’s marketing director Matt recently, and the answer was something I never expected.  In fact, before he answered, I offered my own thoughts which I was sure would be the main reason.  I said, “oh, I guess it’s for your wife or girlfriend or even daughter perhaps right?”.  He looked a bit surprised and stumbled over his words as he said:  “well, ah, sure, I guess that would be a good reason too!”   It was my turn to be surprised at his response so I was eager to know what was his reason for manufacturing and selling pink-handled pocket knives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;check-price--amazon&quot;&gt;Check Price : &lt;span style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Knee-Brace-Hinged-Open-Patella/dp/B001M0A4J4?imprToken=lFcarFcP8vgtc9JVmVVQfQ&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAJFQC6LY6SIMGJTXA&amp;amp;tag=ha-best-braces-patellofemoral-pain-syndrome-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=2025&amp;amp;creative=165953&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001M0A4J4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;c-btn&quot;&gt;AMAZON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;construction&quot;&gt;Construction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, not exactly a beefy, tough, heavy knife.  The handle feels lighter than just about anything I’ve seen and because of no metal liner in the handle, the blade is a bit wobbly (side to side).  It wouldn’t be my choice for any serious outdoor tasks on a campsite or survival scenario that’s for sure!  However, that is not to say there are no good qualities to this knife!  Read on!
Specifications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Weight:                   2.4 oz
Overall length:      7.5 inches
Blade length:         3-1/8 inches
Blade Material:    420 HC
Blade Hardness:  58 HRC
Handle Material: injection molded plastic
Opening:               Thumb studs, manual operation
Mid-lock
Lanyard hole
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blade&quot;&gt;Blade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blade is made of 420 HC steel which is approaching the wear resistance of high carbon and the corrosion-resistance of stainless.  It features Buck’s proprietary heat-treat process.  That’s the good news!  The bad news (well, not super-bad) is that the blade itself looks a bit tarnished and used – even when it’s 100% brand new and unused!  The finish looked like it was supposed to be shiny, but somehow oxidized and got a bit darker.  Then, somehow a thousand tiny marks that look like mini-scratches are visible on the blade surface as well!  After some thought, I think that was not a mistake, but a deliberate result of some finishing or manufacturing process.  It’s really not a big deal though – just thought I’d mention it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a drop-point blade with a bit of a hollow grind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We love the Buck Forever warranty which we think is as good as it gets in the industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has a removable clip if you don’t use it, but unfortunately, it’s not reversible in any way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It features a very solid mid-lock back mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s made of a decent steel that is excellent quality for the price.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully made in the USA (love this one).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gimping on the handle is in two locations to accommodate two different grips.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thumb studs on both sides of the blade with overall good look and feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.The opening of the blade was a bit sticky and felt like a bit too much friction.  The engineering on this issue could be a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While very light, the injection-molded handle feels like a cross between styrofoam and plastic.  It has a cheap feel to it and I always feel like it could break at any moment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using it for heavier-duty tasks, you’ll notice there’s a slight movement of the blade side to side – though it’s minimal and still feels pretty solid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The blade is not beautifully finished.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are no steel liners in the handle for stability and durability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;caution&quot;&gt;Caution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mid-lock back mechanism can release during a backward grip (see video below).  Though this is unlikely to happen to most people, it has happened to owners of this knife in the past.
Hate Pink?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine!  I can understand if you like the knife but hate the color!  If so, you’re in luck!  Why?  Here is your passport to every color combo you can imagine!  Have FUN!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buck 285 Bantam Mossy Oak Pink Camo knife is an overall decent buy.  It’s not my favorite knife, but at its price point, I wouldn’t complain at all!  If the price was higher, I’d make a bigger deal of its shortcomings, but with a $25 price tag, I’m happy to get it for my girl or for my car (assuming I don’t already have 3 in my glove box and car door!)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Use a Foam Roller No Nonsense Guide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s frequently a new gadget that’s touted as a must use in your fitness routine. Foam rollers are no exception. Now mainstream, foam rollers are hyped by fitness gurus as the go-to device for increasing your body’s flexibility, performance and recovery time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolling your body over a tube—what’s that about! Are you puzzled by how to use a foam roller? You’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s roll on and learn about the artful technique of rolling out tension and why this simple exercise device has a raving reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;at-a-glance&quot;&gt;At a Glance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use foam rollers for injury prevention, pre-exercise warm-ups and rehabilitation foam rollers aid in myofascial release through self-massage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foam roller exercises are popular exercise devices, fitness classes support the use of these simple gadgets raising their positive reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The use of foam rollers alongside static-stretch exercise warm-up techniques releases tension in muscles and results in a greater range of motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-foam-rollers&quot;&gt;What Are Foam Rollers?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First for the novice; what’s a foam roller? It’s an exercise device that’s a dense cylindrical tube, and can have a smooth or textured surface. Foam rollers are an inexpensive, versatile exercise equipment that can be used at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising with a foam roller is an alternative way to warm up your muscle groups prior to workout. Foam rollers help stretch out knotted muscle ligaments to decrease tension, improve the range of movement and reduce muscle fatigue. Foam rollers are further used for post-exercise cool down to boost circulation and reduce possible delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), that achy soreness we feel 24 to 48 hours after an intense workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foam rollers are designed for a total-body self-massage technique known as myofascial release (MFR). This technique of deep tissue massage is used to release muscle tightness and soreness prior to a workout and afterward to aid muscle recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By massaging the connective tissues, or fascia, that surrounds your muscles with a foam roller, it’s claimed you can increase your range of motion, boost circulation, stimulate the lymphatic system and reduce muscle tightness and aid flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-use-a-foam-roller&quot;&gt;How to Use a Foam Roller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foam rollers are not difficult to use and there are many reasons to incorporate them into your exercise routine. You can perform foam rolling exercises for the neck, shoulders, upper back, hips, legs and thigh muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a foam roller you work on each muscle group, doing up to three reps, lasting 60 seconds each time. Applying compression to your muscles by leaning on the roller and moving back and forth. Your body weight applies the pressure as the roller moves along the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial use of a foam roller can be uncomfortable, some users even say painful. Using a good technique should not create discomfort and applying a moderate amount of pressure with a small, slow range of movement is best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foam rollers exercises are best for these muscle areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hamstrings and glutes.
Iliotibial band.
Upper back.
Quadriceps.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foam-roller-health-benefits&quot;&gt;Foam Roller Health Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health benefits for your body when exercising with a foam roller are evident and research backs up the claims from fitness gurus. Incorporating foam roller exercises into your fitness routine has numerous benefits we look at science-proven benefits here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-flexibility&quot;&gt;1. Flexibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising pre-workout static stretches have been traditionally used to extend flexibility improving musculoskeletal health, decrease muscle tension and help prevent injury. Foam rollers have been studied when used as part of a combination warm-up stretch exercise alongside static stretching and as an alternative to conventional stretching techniques for increasing flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One four-week trial studied the foam rollers efficiency to increase hamstring flexibility with results showing rollers were as effective as contract-relax PNF stretching method. Another study showed a 4.3 percent increase in the range of motion using foam roller massage as a pre-workout exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-recovery&quot;&gt;2. Recovery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a foam roller post-exercise enables the body to recover faster by helping to flush toxins from the body and increase blood flow to the fatigued muscles. Foam roller exercises aid in reducing delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foam rolling definitely works at reducing stiffness and pain in muscle groups felt after an intense bout of exercise. Studies show at 24 hours post-exercise muscle soreness was reduced in those who had performed post-exercise foam rolling. The technique of foam rolling is a helpful tool for athletes who need to recover quickly from training exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-decreased-injury-risk&quot;&gt;3. Decreased Injury Risk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising without a proper warm-up can lead to an increased risk of injury. Muscles that are tight are more prone to injury, through massaging with a foam roller you increase circulation and blood flow to your muscles, stretch out the muscle and these actions help prevent injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As foam roller exercises increase range of motion, this can help avoid the risk of injury caused by over exercising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-performance&quot;&gt;4. Performance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since foam rolling exercises help reduce muscle fatigue by increasing circulation, the range of movement and post-exercise muscle soreness, it’s assumed that these factors, in turn, improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a certain degree, foam rolling reduces muscle fatigue and may allow you to increase your frequency of exercise sessions and thus improve your performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-type-of-foam-roller-is-best&quot;&gt;What Type of Foam Roller is Best?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foam rollers range from basic smooth surfaced, textured surface to vibrating rollers. The foam density and size differs offering you a wide choice depending on the planned use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller sized rollers are compact and conveniently fit in your gym bag, they work one muscle at a time. The longer foam rollers allow you to do many foam roller exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginners to foam rolling opt for a medium density smooth roller, their flexibility makes them great for long workouts. Harder density foam rollers have a rough-textured surface for massage and are more geared towards professional athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies reveal that different foam rollers may affect the range of motion. One study comparing vibrating foam rollers vs non-vibrating foam rollers found that the greatest increase in the range of motion was reached with the vibrating roller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;common-mistakes-when-using-a-foam-roller&quot;&gt;Common Mistakes When Using a Foam Roller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main common mistake when exercising with a foam roller is too much speed. Going fast when using a foam roller can cause discomfort to your muscles and not achieve the desired warm-up. Since foam rollers are supposed to mimic a hand massage to the muscle area, it makes sense to go slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals over do it on tender or knotted areas, constantly overworking these areas can actually cause bruising and pain. If you have a tender or injured muscle area roll over it with lighter weight and for only 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foam rollers are a cheaply priced piece of fitness equipment that’s easy to use and aids self myofascial release massage. Anything that helps reduce recovery time is a plus. Used correctly foam rollers are painless and the therapeutic benefits are proven by science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A foam roller is an essential fitness gadget great for the fitness newbie and professional alike. It helps condition the body, untighten knots and limbers up your muscle groups so you can get the maximum benefit from your workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A foam roller is an exercise device that’s earned its place in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Top 5 Best Braces for Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome in 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Run Forrest, Run!” Probably one of the most famous phrases in movie history, but how did Forrest run across the whole country without suffering a knee injury? Patellofemoral pain syndrome is referred to as ‘runner’s knee’, but it can affect anybody. The condition is more common in athletes, but also affects office employees and anyone who sits for prolonged periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the good news!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A generic term for pain at the front of the knee, in most cases of patellofemoral pain syndrome there’s no actual damage to the knee joint. Surgery is rarely needed, with common treatments involving physiotherapy or the use of a knee brace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When combined with other knee rehabilitation treatments, a knee support brace will play a key part in relieving patellofemoral pain. If you suffer from a nagging pain at the front of the knee, don’t worry we’ve got you covered as we look at options for the best brace for patellofemoral pain syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is a comprehensive review of ten wireless chargers, picked either because I wanted to see if they were as good as they claimed to be, or because people asked me to look at them specifically. If you don’t want the deep dive and would rather get to the point with some useful takeaways, then here are the top ten wireless chargers on the market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-patellofemoral-pain-syndrome&quot;&gt;What Is Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is our review of the five top throwing knives we’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Is Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patellofemoral syndrome is the condition that describes pain in the front of your knee and around the kneecap, known as the patella. When the patella has improper tracking in the femoral groove, it’ll cause a sharp pain or a dull ache around or underneath the kneecap. This often gets worse with movement around the knee area when going about daily activities or bending the knee while weight bearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it affects millions of us, patellofemoral pain syndrome is more frequent in athletic individuals like runners, hikers or cyclists. A survey found that 25 percent of all knee injuries seen in a sports medicine clinic were related to patellofemoral pain. Overuse of the knee joint and trauma like falling on your kneecaps are common causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor tracking of your patella in the groove at the end of your femur has been linked with patellofemoral pain syndrome too. When you bend your knee, sometimes the kneecap will be pushed out to one side caused by muscular imbalances or weaknesses. While symptoms of patellofemoral syndrome can be extremely painful, the condition can usually be treated in your own home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;patellofemoral-pain-syndrome-treatment&quot;&gt;Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once diagnosed, a doctor will recommend the best course of action for treating your patellofemoral pain. This can include orthotics which take the stress off your lower leg by stabilizing your foot and ankle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which reduce the swelling and relieve the pain are another option. Over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen and acetaminophen will help with healing too. Always consult your doctor before taking any new medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;exercise-to-treat-and-prevent-patellofemoral-pain-syndrome&quot;&gt;Exercise to Treat and Prevent Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gentle exercise and stretches will improve your strength and mobility without risking further damage to the knee. By strengthening the muscles attached to your knee, you’ll reduce the patellofemoral pain. In the following YouTube video, a physiotherapist details some exercises and stretches that’ll get your patella back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rest-and-compression&quot;&gt;Rest and Compression&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As patellofemoral pain syndrome is often caused by overuse or overactivity, resting the affected area can help treat the condition. The RICE method (rest, ice, compression and elevation) will relieve the pain and help reduce any swelling. Taping or a bandage may be used for compression but the effects will decrease over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;patellar-braces&quot;&gt;Patellar Braces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best brace for patellofemoral pain will apply an external force that counteracts improper patella tracking. Studies have shown that patellar braces significantly alter the patellar tracking. One study found using a knee brace alters the position of the patella in the femoral groove of patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Basically it puts your knee back in the groove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A knee support brace will stop the patella from deviating too far laterally, but the patella can move in other planes too. Using a knee brace with therapeutic exercises will help ease that pain more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-best-brace-for-patellofemoral-pain-syndrome&quot;&gt;The Best Brace for Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many types of knee supports available, it can be difficult to know which is the best brace for patellofemoral pain syndrome. It’s important to choose the correct brace to address your type of knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patellar tendinitis is a similar condition but presents itself on the front of your shin bone and treatment normally requires a patella strap. This creates a false insertion point on your tendons which takes pressure from the sore and inflamed area of pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knee braces for patellofemoral pain are usually a sleeve-style of brace that’ll control or restrict the movement of your knee cap. An open patella-design will reduce the stress caused by movement on the kneecap, with many braces featuring a reinforced patella opening. This can take the form of a gel pad or buttress which assists with the medial tracking of the patella and relieve the pressure or stress on your kneecap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve looked at many of the top-selling braces to bring you, in our opinion, the best five options for the best brace for patellofemoral pain syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Bauerfeind GenuTrain P3 Knee Support 
 &lt;img src=&quot;images/posts/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My helpful screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GenuTrain P3 knee brace has been designed to relieve pain from the misalignment of the knee cap with P3 standing for permanent patella protection. Using a corrective strap, an integrated ring-shaped pad holds the kneecap securely and prevents drifting. This knitted brace/sleeve can be used to treat and prevent patellofemoral pain syndrome, chondromalacia, dislocation of the knee or other patella-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we particularly like about this knee brace is the knitted cotton fabric is both breathable and moisture wicking yet offers a medical-grade compression. Along with a wide range of sizing options that go beyond small, medium or large, this sleeve offers an all-day comfortable fit that won’t slip or bunch up. An incorporated viscoelastic Omega pad surrounds your kneecap to relieve pain and provide a massaging pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.The opening of the blade was a bit sticky and felt like a bit too much friction.  The engineering on this issue could be a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While very light, the injection-molded handle feels like a cross between styrofoam and plastic.  It has a cheap feel to it and I always feel like it could break at any moment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using it for heavier-duty tasks, you’ll notice there’s a slight movement of the blade side to side – though it’s minimal and still feels pretty solid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The blade is not beautifully finished.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are no steel liners in the handle for stability and durability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

 If you’re looking for some high-grade support and stabilization, this brace has you covered. Registered internationally as a class 1 medical device with regulatory bodies including the FDA, this brace is manufactured to the highest quality and compliant standards. A side-hinge system and premium-grade neoprene use a non-slip design for the ultimate comfort and support, suitable for everyday activities and sports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reinforced patellar gap aids with patellar tracking while a two-point geared hinge system helps control flexion and extension movements of connected muscles. A variable compression system (VCS) uses three straps to ensure blood flow safety while providing maximum joint protection and stability. One size fits all, is suitable for use by both men and women and is comfortable to wear with the heat therapeutic neoprene fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ultra-lightweight breathable and flexible neoprene fabric means you can enjoy full movement of your lower leg with this sleeve. This comfortable and cozy fitting solution will effectively support your kneecap and relieve it from joint pains. The neoprene is breathable so your leg won’t get too hot and quality Velcro fastenings ensure a secure fit with an additional silicone anti-slip strip to prevent it from sliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three adjustable straps allow you to adjust the tension where you need it with this one-size-fits-all patella brace—recommended for thigh circumferences from 12 to 18 inches. An open-patella design relieves pressure on the kneecap and stabilizes it, with a steel spring side providing more lateral support. This flexible neoprene brace offers you excellent movement, substantial comfort and extra support. Compressions even offers a 100 percent one-year money-back guarantee if you aren’t completely satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The blade is not beautifully finished.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are no steel liners in the handle for stability and durability.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/posts/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My helpful screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comfortable patella support brace features removable plastic hinges, a gel pad around the patella and adjustable Velcro straps. Combined with a supportive structure made from Breath-O-Prene, this brace helps alleviate patella pain and aligns your kneecap during movements. Side hinges provide additional medial/lateral support and provide a constant pull on the kneecap during flexion and extension to realign the patella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high quality Breath-O-Prene provides a comfortable fit with adjustable Velcro straps so you can keep wearing the brace all day without fear of it slipping. The fabric is also antimicrobial, moisture wicking, hypoallergenic, lightweight and breathable. The brace only provides light support, but is ideal for those suffering from patellofemoral pain syndrome or other symptoms of injured patellas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-good-3&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We love the Buck Forever warranty which we think is as good as it gets in the industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has a removable clip if you don’t use it, but unfortunately, it’s not reversible in any way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It features a very solid mid-lock back mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s made of a decent steel that is excellent quality for the price.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully made in the USA (love this one).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gimping on the handle is in two locations to accommodate two different grips.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thumb studs on both sides of the blade with overall good look and feel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bad-3&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.The opening of the blade was a bit sticky and felt like a bit too much friction.  The engineering on this issue could be a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While very light, the injection-molded handle feels like a cross between styrofoam and plastic.  It has a cheap feel to it and I always feel like it could break at any moment.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/posts/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My helpful screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This budget-priced all-purpose knee brace from Vive can help with knee stability and support, preventing or treating the symptoms of patellofemoral pain syndrome. A reinforced open-patella design supports your kneecap and reduces the pressure and stress created by movement. Proper alignment of the ACL and MCL helps to relieve strains, sprains and improves patellar tracking while allowing for a full range of motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secured with three strong hook-and-loop straps, the knee brace fits most knees up to 17.5 inches in circumference. You can also tighten or loosen the straps to achieve the optimal level of compression and support needed for pain relief. A durable Neoprene fabric is used which is naturally moisture wicking and breathable to keep you cool and dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-choice&quot;&gt;Our Choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing a brace to relieve the pain at the front of your knee, it’s most important to choose one which fits securely and offers constant support to the patella. The wide range of six different sizes which go above and beyond the normal universal sizing of similar knee braces, in our opinion, makes the Bauerfeind GenuTrain P3 knee support the best brace for patellofemoral pain syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the price may be higher than many other braces, you’re getting a great-quality knee support that’s been specifically designed for your condition. A soft cotton knitted fabric provides breathable compression and gives anatomic support wherever actually needed with an integrated gel-ring pad to hold the kneecap securely in place. Using this knee support brace will soon get you pounding those tracks again, just with less pain next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-audio-interface&quot;&gt;4. Audio Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a mixing console in a major pro studio, the audio interface is the heart of any project studio, so it’s important to make the right choice. I’ll explain which interface I bought and why, describe its features and how I feel about my decision.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-digital-audio-workstation--control-surfaces&quot;&gt;5. Digital Audio Workstation &amp;amp; Control Surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important choice in setting up a project studio is the choice of Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). There is little to differentiate between DAWs in terms of quality these days, but there are significant differences in interface design, workflow and cost. Platform too (PC vs. Mac) will rule some options out as there are some PC-only and Mac-only options out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-studio-monitors--headphones&quot;&gt;6. Studio Monitors &amp;amp; Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studio monitors and headphones are another critical choice. These determine what you hear and will massively impact the success of your mixes - both in terms of overall balance and how well they translate to other listening devices and environments. I’ll explain what monitors I bought and how I chose them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-cabling&quot;&gt;7. Cabling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the most glamorous subject, but important none-the-less. I’ll go through my cabling choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-future-upgrades&quot;&gt;8. Future Upgrades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll finish off the series with some thoughts on areas where I could improve the studio in future. I have no idea whether I will ever have the budget to implement any of these, but it’s a pleasant way to pass some time!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Blog Platform</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ghost is a joy to use but the cost occurs whether I publish 100 posts a year or zero posts, so it’s clearly easier to justify if I’m posting regularly. But I don’t publish content regularly and with my subscription renewal coming up in December, I decided it’s time to take the plunge and move my blog to a cheaper platform. Enter Jekyll!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-ghost-and-jekyll&quot;&gt;What are Ghost and Jekyll?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source online publishing platform. You have the choice to download the Ghost platform and install it on your own server for free or you can subscribe to a Ghost(Pro) account and have your blog hosted by Ghost (in the same way you can host your own Wordpress site or create an account at Wordpress.com).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you self-host, you will have to manage the server environment, install and configure the Ghost server application and install updates as new versions are released. With a Ghost(Pro) account you are paying to have all that taken care of by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; on the other hand is a static site generator. It transforms plain text (markdown) files into static websites and blogs. It doesn’t require a database and supports permalinks, categories, pages, posts and custom layouts, which makes it ideal for generating blog sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawback is that you run it from the command line (which is a big barrier to entry for some) and there is more set up and configuration than is required with a hosted solution. However, if you are comfortable with all that, once set up it is pretty simple to publish new content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if Ghost(Pro) is analogous to hailing an Uber, Jekyll would be like building your own kit car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is free to use but you still need to host your site somewhere. The good news is that it has very tight integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; so not only can you can benefit from Git version control but also automatic hosting on Github Pages…assuming you are comfortable working in a technical development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-move-from-the-simple-ghostpro-environment-to-the-more-complex-jekyll&quot;&gt;Why move from the simple Ghost(Pro) environment to the more complex Jekyll?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally chose the Ghost platform for its elegance and simplicity. I was happy to pay a nominal $5/month subscription to avoid hosting costs and the time it would take to administer my own website. So I signed up and started blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon realised that whilst I enjoyed the writing process, I was never going to be a prolific blogger. In my first couple of years I was actually quite inconsistent. I had months of posting 3 or 4 times, but then could go months without posting anything. All the time paying Ghost my $5/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 2016, having established a good name and solid customer base, Ghost unsurprisingly increased the cost of the cheapest Ghost(Pro) plan. It went up from $5/month billed monthly to $19/month billed annually or a whopping $29/month billed monthly. However, I liked Ghost so stuck with it, opting to pay annually. Then recently Ghost made an announcement that suggested that their future focus is likely to be journalism and news publications and the likely revenues that will flow from large corporate clients using their platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now my blog is now costing me $228 a year rather than $60. Given my rate of output, that’s a crazy cost per post, especially considering there are plenty of free alternatives. It also got me thinking about the difficulty in moving blog platform when all the content (text and images) are saved on a 3rd party’s servers and only accessible while I continued to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with my Ghost subscription renewal coming up in December I decided it was time to find an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion I came to was that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I would rather manage my own blog site than pay over $200/year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wanted my content saved locally (and backed up in the cloud) to avoid future migration issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wanted to continue to write content in markdown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wanted to avoid a database driven solution if possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had seen Jekyll (in my job as a web developer) and understood how it worked. I’m familiar with using the command line and have used Git version control. So the technical barrier to entry was fortunately not so great for me. I was attracted to the idea of having control of my own site and a system that re-generated the site whenever new content was added. And most importantly it was free and ran on my local machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last piece of the puzzle was hosting. I didn’t want to use a web host (more cost) and so was very happy to read that Github was tightly integrated with Jekyll and provided free hosting through their Github Pages platform. It was a no-brainer really: free source control and publishing rolled into one - count me in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-in-a-theme&quot;&gt;What’s in a theme?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than develop the blog theme from scratch I sourced some open-source themes and tried them out. They all work in the same way so once you understand one, you pretty much understand them all. It definitely helps if you understand front-end web development and are happy to get your hands dirty in the code, tweaking layout and include files and editing configuration files. But a theme got me 95% of the way there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;migrating-old-content&quot;&gt;Migrating old content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to start publishing brand new posts first and migrate my old posts over time. An important job that needs doing is to compress all the photographic images, which are way too big currently and consequently load very slowly. But I’ll get there as fast as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-domain-name&quot;&gt;New domain name&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In moving from the Ghost platform I would need a new domain name. The default URL you get with Github is not very friendly but it does allow you to use a custom domain. So I have spent some of the money I have saved by not renewing my Ghost subscription I have bought a custom domain name: &lt;em&gt;therhythmof.life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;onwards-and-upwards&quot;&gt;Onwards and upwards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all that remains is for me to try harder in 2018 to write more often and more consistently. Now where have I heard that before…?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Blog Platform</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ghost is a joy to use but the cost occurs whether I publish 100 posts a year or zero posts, so it’s clearly easier to justify if I’m posting regularly. But I don’t publish content regularly and with my subscription renewal coming up in December, I decided it’s time to take the plunge and move my blog to a cheaper platform. Enter Jekyll!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-ghost-and-jekyll&quot;&gt;What are Ghost and Jekyll?&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>New Series On My Garden Studio</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-garden-studio&quot;&gt;1. Garden Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll kick the series off by explaining what motivated me to build a garden studio, what I use it for and how this affected design decisions. I’ll cover how I chose a supplier and provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the build from laying the concrete base to the finished building. This may end up being split into two posts if it gets too long: planning/choosing a supplier; build walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-studio-signal-flow&quot;&gt;2. Studio Signal Flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explanation of the audio signal flow from voice/instrument to speakers/headphones. This is a generic flow that could be applied to any studio, but I will describe it in terms of my own set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-microphones&quot;&gt;3. Microphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll cover all the different microphones I own, why I chose them and what I use them for. I’ll also identify where there are gaps in my collection and how I might fill them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-audio-interface&quot;&gt;4. Audio Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a mixing console in a major pro studio, the audio interface is the heart of any project studio, so it’s important to make the right choice. I’ll explain which interface I bought and why, describe its features and how I feel about my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-digital-audio-workstation--control-surfaces&quot;&gt;5. Digital Audio Workstation &amp;amp; Control Surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important choice in setting up a project studio is the choice of Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). There is little to differentiate between DAWs in terms of quality these days, but there are significant differences in interface design, workflow and cost. Platform too (PC vs. Mac) will rule some options out as there are some PC-only and Mac-only options out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-studio-monitors--headphones&quot;&gt;6. Studio Monitors &amp;amp; Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studio monitors and headphones are another critical choice. These determine what you hear and will massively impact the success of your mixes - both in terms of overall balance and how well they translate to other listening devices and environments. I’ll explain what monitors I bought and how I chose them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-cabling&quot;&gt;7. Cabling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the most glamorous subject, but important none-the-less. I’ll go through my cabling choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-future-upgrades&quot;&gt;8. Future Upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll finish off the series with some thoughts on areas where I could improve the studio in future. I have no idea whether I will ever have the budget to implement any of these, but it’s a pleasant way to pass some time!&lt;/p&gt;
